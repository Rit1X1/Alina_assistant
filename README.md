voice assistant

Created an AI voice assistant similar to Google assistant solely using python.
It can do pretty much everything a google assistant can do like searching upon receiving voice commands by the user.
We have added some extra features in it like it can shut down the computer if you command it for the same.

How to use it:
Upon execution of the program, you just need to leave it and continue with your work while it keeps running in the background seeking for a wake-up keyword.
